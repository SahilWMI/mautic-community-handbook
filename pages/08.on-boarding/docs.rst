On-boarding
###########

On-boarding new contributors effectively is a hugely important part of our community.

If new contributors feel welcomed, able to use their time effectively and make a real difference which is recognised by the community, **we all benefit**.

They feel their time is well spent, the Mautic project benefits from their skills and expertise, and **we all move forward together**.

People need to be able to quickly determine how they can offer their skills, find projects with open tasks, and be supported in making their first contributions.

While each team will have some aspects of the on-boarding process in common, there are some elements which will be universal across all teams.
